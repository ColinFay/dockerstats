Description: Run and get the results from a 'docker stats' call.
    Bring inside R the output of the 'docker stats' command line utility
    as a data.frame. This dataframe contains columns with the statistics 
    about one or more container(s). You can also set R to watch recursively '
    docker stats', and manage the result with a callback function 
    (for example, it can be saved to a file to be later analysed).
